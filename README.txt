Raw samples contain the unprocessed output files, as they are captured by the camera (one 16-bit TIFF file per band).

Geotiff orthomosaic samples show a fully processed 4-layer output in Geotiff format. These files contain four reflectance-calibrated bands normalized so that a pixel intensity value of 32768 corresponds to 100% reflectance. Note that these images may not open correctly in some image viewers. They are intended to be viewed using GIS software (QGIS, ArcGIS, ...).

NDVI rendering samples show a false-color rendering of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index generated from the reflectance-calibrated Geotiff.

Spectral bands for sample data:

Band 1: 480nm
Band 2: 550nm
Band 3: 670nm
Band 4: 850nm
Example #1
Captured from 70 meters above ground level.
